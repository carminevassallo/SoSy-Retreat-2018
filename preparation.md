## Preparation for the retreat

To make this retreat a success, we need some help from you. Please provide four (“+1”) things for us:

1. We have a lot new people this time. To make it easier to get to know each other, please add yourself to the yearbook [1]. I copied over the texts that I have collected some time ago, so many people already exist, but you might want to update some things. Please provide an ultra-short CV, your research interests, and a picture.

2. Please think about 3-5 (high-level) research questions that are interesting for you, maybe also for other SoSys, and on which you could see yourself working... we will use these questions in the card sorting to identify good session themes. It is enough if you bring them to the retreat, only people that will not be there on Tuesday should send them to me before.

3. Think about the next paper project that is relevant in your PhD and on which you would like to get feedback in the retreat or maybe even want to start a collaboration on. What is the next thing you want to do?

4. Please prepare a lightning talk that (a) quickly introduces you (b) briefly covers your research, and (c) introduces your next paper idea in a nut-shell. The talk should be ~3min long and you will give it at the beginning of one of the sessions. This session is then an excellent opportunity to get feedback, find collaborators, or figure out details of the methodology.

5. We are not going to summarize the results of the retreat in the closing session, but we will reserve the next SoftTalk slot for that. The goal is that -after the retreat- everybody should have a new concrete project idea to work on, which has direct relevance for his PhD. We will announce more details about this at the retreat.
